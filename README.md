This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Welcome to the Codepub

ðŸŒ± Lets get you started with this introduction into data-driven accountability and growth

## Getting Started

Open your IDE (e.g Visual Studio Code) and open a new Terminal.

First, run the following command in the terminal (make sure the path you see in the terminal ends with our codepub app name):

```bash
npm install
```

to install all the additional libraries we need. They are defined in the [package.json file](./package.json)

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start your application. Your terminal will show you on which port the application is started and a link where you can access it in the browser.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the landing page of the application.

ðŸŒŸ Find the instructions on the app and youre all ready to start coding ðŸŒŸ

## Getting Started with Sandbox

Navigate to [https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/codepub-rp8p8p](https://codesandbox.io/p/devbox/codepub-rp8p8p)

In order to work with the sandbox you need to create an account. Once you have created an account and you're logged in you can start editing files, codesandbox will automatically create a copy in your space.

If you don't see the web application on the right side, you'll need to open the terminal inside of the sandbox and run the following commands:

```bash
npm install
```

to install all the additional libraries we need. They are defined in the [package.json file](./package.json)

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start your application. Your terminal will show you on which port the application is started and a link where you can access it in the browser of sandbox.
