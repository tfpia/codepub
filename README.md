This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Welcome to the Codepub

ðŸŒ± Lets get you started with this introduction into data-driven accountability and growth

## Getting Started

Open your IDE (e.g Visual Studio Code) and open a new Terminal.

First, run the following command in the terminal (make sure the path you see in the terminal ends with our codepub app name):

```bash
npm install
```

to install all the additional libaries we need. They are defined in the [package.json file](./package.json)

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start your application. Your terminal will show you on which port the application is started and a link where you can access it in the browser.

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the landing page of the application.

ðŸŒŸ Find the instructions on the app and youre all ready to start coding ðŸŒŸ
