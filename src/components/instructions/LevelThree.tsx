          Now that we can interact with the visualisation we want to learn
          something from it. Making decisions based on data is nothing new in
          the tech world. For this we use data-driven decision-making (DDDM)

          Think about what you would like to read out of the visualisation. E.g
          what was the month with the most savings, or what is the average
          saving during one week? But get creative.

          üí° Choose one metric you would like to display and display it on the
          page of the visualisation. This can be done as a simple text or maybe
          you want to use a second visualisation to display trends in your habit
          tracking.

              We provided an example of the average saving per month. You can
              start writing your own function and use ours as a solution
              reference or as an inspiration.
              <br />
              <br />
              Search for the function 'generateMonthsForYear' in the file
              <i>src/utils/utils.ts.</i>
              <br />
              <br />
              At the end of the function we push month, weeks, totalValue,
              averageValue in monthsForYear. This means that you can see
              averageValue in <i>src/app/visualisation/page.tsx</i> in your
              console.log(data). <br />
              <br />
              Now place it around or in the React component {`<Month/>`} and use
              Math.round() to display the average value rounded to the nearest
              integer.
